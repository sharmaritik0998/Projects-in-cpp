# 🚀 Projects in C++

Welcome to my **C++ Projects Repository**!  
This repository showcases a collection of projects developed using **C++**, ranging from basic to advanced level. These projects reflect my understanding of core programming concepts, data structures, algorithms, and real-world problem-solving using C++.

## 🧠 Purpose

This repository serves to:
- Demonstrate my practical knowledge of C++  
- Apply core concepts like OOP, STL, file handling, and algorithms  
- Build console-based and modular C++ applications  
- Share reusable code with others learning or building with C++

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++  
- **Concepts:**  
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
  - Standard Template Library (STL)  
  - File I/O  
  - Recursion, Sorting, Searching  
  - Linked Lists, Trees, Stacks, Queues  
  - Graphs and Greedy/Dynamic Programming techniques
